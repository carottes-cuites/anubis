**Anubis**
===========
**Presentation**
Anubis is a *Discord* audio bot. It is used to provide access to popular audio-stream services into your voice channels.

**What can I do ?**
At the moment, you can stream from the following services :
 - *Deezer* : Listen tracks previews 
 - *Twitch* : Listen to your favorite stream while you are busy playing with your teammates.

**What are the interactions limits ?**
Interactions with the bot are focused on the stream control & feed :
 - **Add to queue** : Add content fro many kind of service recognized by the bot to the queue (it's your server's queue). Just type service & track's name to add it and play automatically! 
 - **Control server stream** : Pause, resume, next, stop the stream whenever you want.

**Syntax**
Message structure should respect this syntax :
**@anubis-bot-name** *service-name* service-parameter < your query >

**Example**
If you want to share a preview of a new single hosted on *Deezer*, all you need is to connect to Anubis's voice channel then type "**@anubis** *deezer* your_single_name" in any channel you want to stream it!

**What is coming next ?**
We plan to add new services such as :
- *Soundcloud* : when their app registration service will be up. 
- *Spotify*
- *Dropbox* : stream your own content on your *Discord*, as long as you don't f*ck with the law.
